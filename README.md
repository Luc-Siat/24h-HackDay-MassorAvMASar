Some context:

  The Project is itself a dog meet up app where one can create an account to share his/her dog and exchange with other owners.

  The time was not sufficient to have proper authorization and authentication therefore the user details are only stored in the plain text in the DB. The app was made for tablet/phone and does not provide a specific UI for computers.
